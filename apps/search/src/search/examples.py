I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.Anyway, I can't wait to go back!",

They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",

        "text":"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",

The food is that good.This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",

I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming.

It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",

We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good.

Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.",

Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!",

I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness!

Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.",

        "text":"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.",

        "text":"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.Service was excellent, and highly attentive.Food, absolutely horrible.My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",

        "text":"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded \"hover over a table to get a seat\" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded \"Panera Bread\" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a \"mass produced\" feeling and taste.The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  The \"side of pancakes\" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!",

        "text":"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, \"how nice\", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a \"different\" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",

        "text":"Cliff notes- Cheap: $1-2/plate- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lolThis place is definitely good for what it is, \"it\" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to \"reduce costs\" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).For those claiming to be \"left to fend for themselves\" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called \"the menu\" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as \"descriptions\" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAFAnd the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!",

It's rather small, but they have a wide selection of Japanese, snacks, beverages (including my new fave beer, Asahi Black), refrigerated items, staples, etc.  This is not an Asian market, it's specifically Japanese, so don't expect more than a few crossover items like kimchi.  That being said, sometimes it's good to specialize.  It lets them carry more variety of Japanese products.The cashier was very friendly when I finally stopped loading my basket long enough to check out.  Like the first reviewer, I loaded up with snacks for the hotel room...along with a six-pack of Asahi Black, of course.  Oh, one more important factor...the prices were quite reasonable, in line with most ethnic market imports...maybe even a bit cheaper than usual.",

The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.

The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.

Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.

        "text":"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",

The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.",

But I was underwhelmed with both. You can get a much better burger next door at Yardhouse and a much better selection of Margaritas from Salty Senorita. With that aside this place is quite the spectacle. It has 2 stories, a stage, fishing boat booths, and every other piece of decor that a Parrothead could love. TV's broadcast Jimmy himself rocking out and some odd montages of Parrothead outings. Live music is offered here several nights of the week and they offer 2-3 bar areas. If defiantly won't become part of the regular rotation but from time to time we might wonder in looking for our lost shaker of salt.",

I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!

You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of \"fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.After you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return.",

Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )",

I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",

        "text":"The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.*Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",

We scored a few seats at the bar, the place was SUPER crowded (which is a good sign on a Wednesday). I started with a beer called Banana Bread, which was awesome. Wifey had a glass of wine, but I can't remember what it was. We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries. The calamari was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were awesome (although the bed of rice it came on was meh), and the mini reubens were great as well. I was super excited to try it, and it delivered.

        "text":"Beer...or Yoga?Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: NAMASTE!",

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is. I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. you will not be disappointed.",

As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entr√©e or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!",

They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.",

        "text":"Quiessence is, simply put, beautiful.  Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",

The food is that good.This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.",

I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! The basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.All the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming.

It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!Next up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.My entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.It wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.",

We weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. Anyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) There is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.For $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. There was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good.

Better then Dennys but not as good as Mimi's. I had the all u can eat of beef ribs, lasagna, meat loaf, cat fish, chicken, mashed and diced potatoes, stuffing, rice, homemade apple pie, etc and salad bar. I know I am missing a bunch of stuff they had but you get the drift. They run specials on Prime rib and stuff so you might want to call to see what they are serving the night you go.",

Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.The menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!Anyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!",

I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy. I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness!

Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.",

        "text":"Never having dealt with a Discount Tire in Phoenix before (only in Texas, and their service has been great all the time), I came in not knowing what kind of service to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!TIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.",

        "text":"I've eaten here many times, but none as bad as last night.Service was excellent, and highly attentive.Food, absolutely horrible.My expectation was they would serve a steak on par with their seafood. After all, they were charging 39 bucks for a ribeye. What I was hoping for was a 1- 1-1/2' thick steak, cooked Pittsburgh style as I had ordered. What I got a a 3/4 in thick piece of meat that was mostly fat, gristle, and in no way resembled Pittsburgh Style. Salad, similar to something you could get at Chick FiletVeggies, blah.Bread basket, ample, but day old, and if not, it certainly wasn't fresh. In addition to bad food, we were crammed into a small room where we were nuts to butts with 6 other tables, listening to conversations ranging from someone's recent bout with pinkeye, and another couple who elected to speak entirely in French, until the waiter showed up, then it was like they turned off the French switch and suddenly began speaking English. I've had it with this place.If I'm going to pay 150 bucks for dinner, it'll be at Mortons, or Maestro where the steaks are 1-1/2 in thick, cooked to perfection, and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristle",

        "text":"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded \"hover over a table to get a seat\" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded \"Panera Bread\" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a \"mass produced\" feeling and taste.The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  The \"side of pancakes\" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!",

        "text":"After my last review, somewhat scathing regarding the burgers, I got an invite from the management to come down, meet the chef and give him another try.  I thought to myself, \"how nice\", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.So, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a \"different\" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.",

        "text":"Cliff notes- Cheap: $1-2/plate- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lolThis place is definitely good for what it is, \"it\" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to \"reduce costs\" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).For those claiming to be \"left to fend for themselves\" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called \"the menu\" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as \"descriptions\" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAFAnd the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!",

It's rather small, but they have a wide selection of Japanese, snacks, beverages (including my new fave beer, Asahi Black), refrigerated items, staples, etc.  This is not an Asian market, it's specifically Japanese, so don't expect more than a few crossover items like kimchi.  That being said, sometimes it's good to specialize.  It lets them carry more variety of Japanese products.The cashier was very friendly when I finally stopped loading my basket long enough to check out.  Like the first reviewer, I loaded up with snacks for the hotel room...along with a six-pack of Asahi Black, of course.  Oh, one more important factor...the prices were quite reasonable, in line with most ethnic market imports...maybe even a bit cheaper than usual.",

The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  They could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.

The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.

Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.

        "text":"In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night. Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.",

The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!But the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!When we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.I was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  I ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!When we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.When she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.",

But I was underwhelmed with both. You can get a much better burger next door at Yardhouse and a much better selection of Margaritas from Salty Senorita. With that aside this place is quite the spectacle. It has 2 stories, a stage, fishing boat booths, and every other piece of decor that a Parrothead could love. TV's broadcast Jimmy himself rocking out and some odd montages of Parrothead outings. Live music is offered here several nights of the week and they offer 2-3 bar areas. If defiantly won't become part of the regular rotation but from time to time we might wonder in looking for our lost shaker of salt.",

I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter. La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!

You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!The menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of \"fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... We always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.After you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return.",

Mostly it is because of the wide range of specialty items that they have on hand. Whether it's something for the garden, a gift for the new bride or baby, a unique piece of art, or heavenly scented candles - you will not be disappointed.The owners / staff are super friendly and have always been more than willing to help find something within a price range or based on occasion / need. And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.The final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds. Ask to be put on their mailing list to ensure your have a heads up and get there early because long time customers like myself never miss it. : )",

I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",

        "text":"The vibe exuding from this place is pure awesomeness. Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. I am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.So as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.*Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.Green serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  Might I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.",

We scored a few seats at the bar, the place was SUPER crowded (which is a good sign on a Wednesday). I started with a beer called Banana Bread, which was awesome. Wifey had a glass of wine, but I can't remember what it was. We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries. The calamari was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were awesome (although the bed of rice it came on was meh), and the mini reubens were great as well. I was super excited to try it, and it delivered.

        "text":"Beer...or Yoga?Located in a small center just east of Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe (a reasonable distance from the light rail on Apache), is an amazing, classy studio for the Mind-Body connection.Mr. Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel. After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.Luckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.I did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. Now for the cliched Yoga Review ending: NAMASTE!",

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is. I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) Wine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. you will not be disappointed.",

As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entr√©e or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!",
