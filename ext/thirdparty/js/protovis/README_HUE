Makefile
--------
	* removed js/lang/init.js from concat. 
	* This is done for efficency. We don't use function expressions that require the eval within init.js

js/mark/Panel.js
----------------
	* modified the pv.Panel.prototype.buildImplied function.
	* The following isn't the best solution, however it has the least impact on the library. 
	* There is some discussion going on how protovis is going to expose its interface for easier dynamic scripting. 
	* Waiting for resolution before dramatic impact is made on code base. 
	* In short I wanted the ability to have the graph injected into an element instead of before it in the DOM tree. 
	* This does not break any demos or existing API.
