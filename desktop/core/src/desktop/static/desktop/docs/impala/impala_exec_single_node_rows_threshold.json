{"body":"<div><p>\n      This setting controls the cutoff point (in terms of number of rows scanned) below which Impala treats a query\n      as a <q>small</q>  query, turning off optimizations such as parallel execution and native code generation. The\n      overhead for these optimizations is applicable for queries involving substantial amounts of data, but it\n      makes sense to skip them for queries involving tiny amounts of data. Reducing the overhead for small queries\n      allows Impala to complete them more quickly, keeping YARN resources, admission control slots, and so on\n      available for data-intensive queries.\n    </p> <p id=\"../Impala/docs/topics/impala_exec_single_node_rows_threshold.xml_syntax_blurb\"><b>Syntax:</b> </p> <div class=\"sql-docs-code-block\">SET EXEC_SINGLE_NODE_ROWS_THRESHOLD=<span class=\"sql-docs-variable\">number_of_rows</span> </div><p><b>Type:</b>  numeric\n    </p> <p><b>Default:</b>  100\n    </p> <p><b>Usage notes:</b>  Typically, you increase the default value to make this optimization apply to more queries.\n      If incorrect or corrupted table and column statistics cause Impala to apply this optimization\n      incorrectly to queries that actually involve substantial work, you might see the queries being slower as a\n      result of remote reads. In that case, recompute statistics with the <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">COMPUTE STATS</span> \n      or <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS</span>  statement.

If Impala cannot\n      accurately estimate the size of the input data, this setting does not apply.\n    </p> <p>\n      In Impala 2.3 and higher, where Impala supports the complex data types <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">STRUCT</span> ,\n      <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">ARRAY</span> , and <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">MAP</span> , if a query refers to any column of those types,\n      the small-query optimization is turned off for that query regardless of the\n      <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">EXEC_SINGLE_NODE_ROWS_THRESHOLD</span>  setting.\n    </p> <p>\n      For a query that is determined to be <q>small</q> , all work is performed on the coordinator node.
