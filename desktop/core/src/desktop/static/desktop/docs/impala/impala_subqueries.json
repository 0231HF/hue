{"body":"<div><p>\n      A <span class=\"sql-docs-variable\">subquery</span>  is a query that is nested within another query. Subqueries let queries on one table\n      dynamically adapt based on the contents of another table. This technique provides great flexibility and\n      expressive power for SQL queries.\n    </p> <p>\n      A subquery can return a result set for use in the <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">FROM</span>  or <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">WITH</span>  clauses, or\n      with operators such as <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">IN</span>  or <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">EXISTS</span> .\n    </p> <p>\n      A <span class=\"sql-docs-variable\">scalar subquery</span>  produces a result set with a single row containing a single column, typically\n      produced by an aggregation function such as <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">MAX()</span>  or <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">SUM()</span> . This single\n      result value can be substituted in scalar contexts such as arguments to comparison operators. If the result\n      set is empty, the value of the scalar subquery is <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">NULL</span> . For example, the following query\n      finds the maximum value of <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">T2.Y</span>  and then substitutes that value into the\n      <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">WHERE</span>  clause of the outer block that queries <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">T1</span> :\n    </p> <div class=\"sql-docs-code-block\">SELECT x FROM t1 WHERE x > (SELECT MAX(y) FROM t2);<br/></div><p><span class=\"sql-docs-variable\">Uncorrelated subqueries</span>  do not refer to any tables from the outer block of the query. The same\n      value or set of values produced by the subquery is used when evaluating each row from the outer query block.\n      In this example, the subquery returns an arbitrary number of values from <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">T2.Y</span> , and each\n      value of <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">T1.X</span>  is tested for membership in that same set of values:\n    </p> <div class=\"sql-docs-code-block\">SELECT x FROM t1 WHERE x IN (SELECT y FROM t2);<br/></div><p><span class=\"sql-docs-variable\">Correlated subqueries</span>  compare one or more values from the outer query block to values referenced\n      in the <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">WHERE</span>  clause of the subquery. Each row evaluated by the outer <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">WHERE</span> \n      clause can be evaluated using a different set of values. These kinds of subqueries are restricted in the\n      kinds of comparisons they can do between columns of the inner and outer tables.
