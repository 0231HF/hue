Normally, those statements produce one or more data\n        files per data node. If the write operation involves small amounts of data, a Parquet table, and/or a\n        partitioned table, the default behavior could produce many small files when intuitively you might expect\n        only a single output file. <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">SET NUM_NODES=1</span>  turns off the <q>distributed</q>  aspect of the\n        write operation, making it more likely to produce only one or a few data files.\n      </p> <div class=\"sql-docs-note\"><p>\n      Because this option results in increased resource utilization on a single host,\n      it could cause problems due to contention with other Impala statements or\n      high resource usage. Symptoms could include queries running slowly, exceeding the memory limit,\n      or appearing to hang.
