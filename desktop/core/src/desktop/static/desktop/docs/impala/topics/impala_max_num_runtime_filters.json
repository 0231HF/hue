There are typically 5 or fewer filters per plan fragment.\n    </p><p>\n      Impala evaluates the effectiveness of each filter, and keeps the\n      ones that eliminate the largest number of partitions or rows.\n      Therefore, this setting can protect against\n      potential problems due to excessive memory overhead for filter production,\n      while still allowing a high level of optimization for suitable queries.\n    </p><p>\n        Because the runtime filtering feature applies mainly to resource-intensive\n        and long-running queries, only adjust this query option when tuning long-running queries\n        involving some combination of large partitioned tables and joins involving large tables.\n      </p><p><b>Kudu considerations:</b></p><p>\n        This query option affects only Bloom filters, not the min/max filters\n        that are applied to Kudu tables. Therefore, it does not affect the\n        performance of queries against Kudu tables.\n      </p><p><b>Related information:</b></p><p><a class=\"hue-doc-external-link\" href=\"https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/impala_runtime_filtering.html\" target=\"_blank\">Runtime Filtering for Impala Queries (Impala 2.5 or higher only)</a>,\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_runtime_bloom_filter_size.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"runtime_bloom_filter_size\">RUNTIME_BLOOM_FILTER_SIZE Query Option (Impala 2.5 or higher only)</a>,\n      <a class=\"hue-doc-internal-link\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-doc-ref=\"topics/impala_runtime_filter_mode.xml\" data-doc-anchor-id=\"runtime_filter_mode\">RUNTIME_FILTER_MODE Query Option (Impala 2.5 or higher only)</a></p></div></div></div>","title":"MAX_NUM_RUNTIME_FILTERS Query Option (Impala 2.5 or higher only)"}
