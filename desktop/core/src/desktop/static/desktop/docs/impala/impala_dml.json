{"body":"<div><p>\n      DML refers to <q>Data Manipulation Language</q> , a subset of SQL statements that modify the data stored in\n      tables. Because Impala focuses on query performance and leverages the append-only nature of HDFS storage,\n      currently Impala only supports a small set of DML statements:\n    </p> <ul><li>.

Works for Kudu tables only.\n      </li> </ul> <p><span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">INSERT</span>  in Impala is primarily optimized for inserting large volumes of data in a single\n      statement, to make effective use of the multi-megabyte HDFS blocks. This is the way in Impala to create new\n      data files. If you intend to insert one or a few rows at a time, such as using the <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">INSERT ...\n      VALUES</span>  syntax, that technique is much more efficient for Impala tables stored in HBase. See\n      <span>impala hbase</span> for details.\n    </p> <p><span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">LOAD DATA</span>  moves existing data files into the directory for an Impala table, making them\n      immediately available for Impala queries. This is one way in Impala to work with data files produced by other\n      Hadoop components. (<span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE</span>  is the other alternative; with external tables,\n      you can query existing data files, while the files remain in their original location.)\n    </p> <p>\n      In Impala 2.8 and higher, Impala does support the <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">UPDATE</span> , <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">DELETE</span> ,\n      and <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">UPSERT</span>  statements for Kudu tables.\n      For HDFS or S3 tables, to simulate the effects of an <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">UPDATE</span>  or <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">DELETE</span>  statement\n      in other database systems, typically you use <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">INSERT</span>  or <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">CREATE TABLE AS SELECT</span>  to copy data\n      from one table to another, filtering out or changing the appropriate rows during the copy operation.\n    </p> <p>\n      You can also achieve a result similar to <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">UPDATE</span>  by using Impala tables stored in HBase.\n      When you insert a row into an HBase table, and the table\n      already contains a row with the same value for the key column, the older row is hidden, effectively the same\n      as a single-row <span class=\"sql-docs-inline-code\">UPDATE</span> .\n    </p> <p>\n      Impala can perform DML operations for tables or partitions stored in the Amazon S3 filesystem\n      with Impala 2.6 and higher. See <span>s3</span> for details.\n    </p> <p id=\"../Impala/docs/topics/impala_dml.xml_related_info\"><b>Related information:</b> </p> <p>\n      The other major classifications of SQL statements are data definition language (see\n      <a href=\"javascript: void(0);\" class=\"lang-ref-link\" data-target=\"topics/impala_ddl.xml#ddl\">DDL Statements</a>) and queries (see <a href=\"javascript: void(0);\" class=\"lang-ref-link\" data-target=\"topics/impala_select.xml#select\">SELECT Statement</a>).\n    </p> </div> ","title":"DML Statements"}
