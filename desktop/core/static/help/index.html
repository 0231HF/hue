<h1><a name="WelcometoHue-WelcometoHue%21"></a>Welcome to Hue!</h1>

<p>Hue is a browser-based environment that enables you to interact with a Hadoop cluster. Hue includes several easy to use applications that help you work with Hadoop Map/Reduce jobs, Hive queries, and user accounts. The Hue applications run in a Web browser and require no client installation. </p>

<h3><a name="WelcometoHue-StartingApplications"></a>Starting Applications</h3>

<p>To open a Hue application, click the appropriate tab in the navigation bar at the top of the Hue web browser window. To open a second application concurrently (or a second instance of the same application), open it in a new tab (right-click on the tab and select "Open link in new tab").</p>

<h3><a name="WelcometoHue-DisplayingHelpfortheHueApplications"></a>Displaying Help for the Hue Applications</h3>

<p>To display the help text for a Hue application, click the <b>Help</b> tab in the Hue Navigation Bar, then click the appropriate link in the Help navigation bar at the top of the Help window. </p>

<h3><a name="WelcometoHue-LoggingInandOut"></a>Logging In and Out</h3>

<p>To log out of Hue, click the "Sign out" link at the top left corner of the Hue web browser window, next to your user name.</p>

<h3><a name="WelcometoHue-NoticeofMisconfiguration"></a>Notice of Misconfiguration</h3>

<p>If Hue detects a misconfiguration, an indicator <img class="emoticon" src="/static/art/help/help_16.gif" height="16" width="16" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/> appears in the navigation bar at the top of the page.  Clicking this takes you to the <b>Check for misconfiguration</b> page which will indicate the potential misconfiguration(s) with hints about fixing them. </p>

<h3><a name="WelcometoHue-ChangingyourPassword"></a>Changing your Password</h3>

<p>If authentication is managed by Hue (that is, authentication is not managed via some external mechanism), you can use the User Admin application to change your password. For more information, see the User Admin Help.</p>

<h3><a name="WelcometoHue-SeekingHelp%2CReportingBugs%2CandProvidingFeedback"></a>Seeking Help, Reporting Bugs, and Providing Feedback</h3>
