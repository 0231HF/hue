<h1><a name="WelcometoHue-WelcometoHue%21"></a>Welcome to Hue!</h1>

<p>Hue is a browser-based environment that enables you to interact with a Hadoop cluster. Hue includes several easy to use applications that help you work with Hadoop Map/Reduce jobs, Hive queries, and user accounts. The Hue applications run in a Web browser and require no client installation. </p>
