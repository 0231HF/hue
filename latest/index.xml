      <description>Start from a release tarball or building the project yourself.
Then configure $PREFIX with the path where you want to install Hue by running:
PREFIX=/usr/share make install cd /usr/share/hue  You can install Hue anywhere on your system, and run Hue as a non-root user.
It is a good practice to create a new user for Hue and either install Hue in that user&amp;rsquo;s home directory, or in a directory within /usr/share.</description>

      <description>The User Admin application lets a superuser add, delete, and manage Hue users and groups, and configure group permissions. Superusers can add users and groups individually, or import them from an LDAP directory. Group permissions define the Hue applications visible to group members when they log into Hue and the application features available to them.

      <description>Hue requires a SQL database to store small amounts of data, including user account information as well as history of job submissions and Hive queries. By default, Hue is configured to use the embedded database SQLite for this purpose, and should require no configuration or management by the administrator. However, MySQL is the recommended database to use. This section contains instructions for configuring Hue to access MySQL and other databases.</description>

After installation, you can use Hue by navigating to http://myserver:8888/.
Next step is to configure Hue to point to the external services. Then, the user guide will help users go through the various installed applications.
